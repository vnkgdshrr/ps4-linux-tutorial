## Kernels
Let's start with the kernels: they are very important as they have the software that controls all of the PS4's hardware. This is, by definition, Linux.

This is the section for recommended kernels. There are both vanilla kernels and performance kernels. Ordered by newest to oldest, the top ones are the recommended ones.

[Credits for all of these kernels](/ending#credits).

::: details Read this if you're confused!
### Do kernel versions matter?
The community has moved on from 6.15 to 6.18, and now there is also active 7.0 kernel work for Aeolia and Belize. Baikal has now being ported to 7.0 after years of being stuck on 5.4 thanks to rmux.

### What about more performance?
The newest kernels are already built with all the necessary patches to make the console work as good as it can, so there's no need to modify anything anymore.
LTO is a topic of debate, but both ThinLTO and FullLTO are good options.

### Kernel list
These are normal general-use kernels with additional patches to make them work properly on the PS4.

### Server kernels
If you are using the PS4 as a server, use these instead of the normal desktop-oriented builds when available.

> [!TIP]
> Pair server kernels with the `128MB` server payload unless you have a specific reason not to.

## Initramfs
This is the rescue shell that boots your Linux installer/installation. Think of it as GRUB, but more basic.

Download [this one](https://github.com/DionKill/ps4-linux-tutorial/blob/main/PS4%20Linux/initramfs.zip). [Source (not really)](https://bitbucket.org/piotrkarbowski/better-initramfs/src/master/).

::: details More details
There's another in-dev initramfs (probably not working), if you want to check out the source it's [here](https://github.com/ps4gentoo/initramfs).

Also, you may want to read [this post](https://ps4linux.com/forums/d/93-tutorial-for-building-a-custom-initramfs-research-development) on the PS4 Linux forums, it explains what an initramfs is and does in actuality.

## Distros (that you ACTUALLY wanna use)
Honestly there's a neptillion distros... If you're indecisive, click on all the links and check them out. Either way they are listed from most to least recommended.

::: details More about these distros
Each distro has it's own pros and cons. But most of the difference on PS4 comes down to drivers; each distro requires it's own version of them and it can be a pain in the ass to install.

**Arch based distros are recommended**, but not because you need to be part of the elite. They are the only ones that currently have automatic updates (meaning with the rest of the system) without breaking anything.

You can of course use other distros, but you do run the risk of breaking your distro or having to reinstall everything when something needs updating, unless you know what you are doing.

### More distros
Here are the distros that we can't recommend anymore, as they have been superseeded, or haven't had any major updates in a while.

It may be useful to you if you want something other than Arch, or if you have a Baikal southbridge.
