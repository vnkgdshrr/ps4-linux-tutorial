## Launching Linux Rescue Shell
After that, either launch your payload with a payload website to load them, or use "Payload Guest" app if the website doesn't work for you.

> [!TIP]
> Remember that the amount of VRAM you allocate is taken from your system memory!
> For a 2GB of VRAM payload, you'd have 8-2 = 6GB of remaining system RAM!
> You aren't creating memory out of thin air!

### Payload website hosts

> You MUST use a 1GB VRAM payload for installation and first boot. Afterwards, 2GB is recommended.


Follow these steps:
- Go to [psfree-enhanced.free.nf](http://psfree-enhanced.free.nf/)
- Select Linux tab at the top center
	- Wait for the cache to finish installing!
- Load your desired payload
	- Again, 1GB is necessary for first time installation!
	- If you use the PS4 as a server after installation, switch to one of the server payloads for more system RAM.

Even though this website is probably not maintained anymore it'll stay here, as the newer website doesn't work on low firmwares.

- [ps4boot.free.nf](http://ps4boot.free.nf) (5.05-12.02) (GoldHEN method, works only with HTTP not HTTPS)

> [!TIP]
> Server payloads are available in `32MB`, `64MB`, and `128MB` VRAM variants.
> Use `128MB` by default for server or general headless use, as `32MB` and `64MB` can cause display issues on some setups.

If the website doesn't work, use the Payload Guest local method below.
### Local payloads
If you so desire, or you can't launch it from the web browser for some reason, it's possible to load these payloads locally.

In order to do that, you need to download them [here](https://github.com/ArabPixel/ps4-linux-payloads/releases/).

#### Local payloads setup
- Install "Payload Guest" or similar app on your PS4 to load the payloads locally
- Extract from the ELF folders, and rename the file to have a `.bin` extension instead of `.elf`, because Payload Loader can't load ELFs
	- Using the `.elf` seems to lead to a higher success rate when launching
	- Enable "see file extensions" on Windows Explorer or what you're using
- Put the files in the `/data/payloads/` directory
- Remember to check here sometimes to see if there's any updates
